# AffiliateTunnels — Future Roadmap

## Editor UX
- [ ] **Responsive Preview Toggles** — Desktop / Tablet / Mobile buttons in the editor toolbar that resize the preview area (760px / 480px / 375px) so users can see how pages look on each device while editing
- [ ] **Multi-Variation A/B Testing** — Allow multiple headlines, images, and descriptions per page. Auto-generate combinations for split testing (inspired by Taboola/Realize Performance ad builder)
- [ ] **AI Assistant Panel** — Persistent AI chat sidebar in the editor for real-time suggestions while building pages

## Competitive Reference
- **Realize Performance (realizeperformance.com)** — Native ad platform with screen-size preview, multi-variation editor (headlines × images × descriptions), AI headline/description suggestions, and an integrated AI assistant in the right column
